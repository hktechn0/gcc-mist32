   entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an
   ordinary field of that type.  In addition, the bit-field is placed
   within the structure so that it would fit within such a field,
   not crossing a boundary for it.

   would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
   alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not

   there is no difference in cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.
